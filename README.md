# my_shop

my_shop is a simple e-commerce app that is built with flutter and firebase as the backend for authentication and storing data. The features includes:

1. It displays products in the virtual/online shop (store) from where it can be added to a virtual cart. 
2. You can filter the list of products that you mark as favorite.
3. Your can make an order from the cart. 
4. You can manage products yourself. You can do that by modifying the details of the products and you can as well create a new product yourselve.

NB: It's an app built alongside learning so it's not perfect.
